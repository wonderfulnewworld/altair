# Altair: Guide to the Skies
The Altair System for Foundry VTT.
A fully original tabletop system built from the ground up, taking inspiration from SRPGs and video games in general as opposed to traditional TTRPGs. This release contains mostly-usable character sheets for both Players and Enemies, for the required minimal play experience, with more to come in the future.
