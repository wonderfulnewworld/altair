# Altair: Guide to the Skies
The Altair System for Foundry Virtual Tabletop.

A fully original tabletop system built from the ground up, taking inspiration from SRPG/JRPGs and video games in general as opposed to more traditional TTRPGs. This release contains mostly-usable character sheets for both Players and Enemies, for the required minimal play experience, with more to come in the future.
